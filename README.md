# database_project

Database Purpose:

This database is built for a cloud computing platform that allows users to rent virtual machines to execute computer applications and computations. It serves to maintain the company's cloud resources like MachineImages, Instances, Storage, etc. It provides security by encrypting sensitive information like Users' passwords and their Card Details. It automatically creates a bill and executes a transaction once the user stops using an Instance. It is built with the intuition that the users can configure their own virtual machines and request additional infrastructure for a specified price. Overall, this database facilitates data collection, processing, billing, transactions and reporting of various processes in this business environment.
